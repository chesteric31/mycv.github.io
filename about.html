      <p>
        I've always been passionate by computers.<br />
        When I've finished my bachelor, I was sure that I've made the right choice.<br />
        In my career, I've been working with so many inspiring people as other developers, architects and functional analysts.<br/>
        All these collaborations built my technicals and human skills.
        </p>
      <p>
        Finally, my main goal in programming is to build maintainable, robust, flexible and automatically tested softwares ðŸ¤“.
